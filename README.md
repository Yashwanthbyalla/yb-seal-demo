## Usage

In HTML, add a `yb-seal` class to make sure it tracks the respective element and behave accordingly with the scroll. Along with this add the animation name as value, for example:

```html
<div class="yb-seal yb-seal-slide-right"></div>
```

It will look for all classes with a `yb-seal` class and launch it's respective animation based on viewport scroll.

## Animations
In **seal** you can easily change animation's classes, by adding a proper `yb-seal` classes:
- `yb-seal-duration` - changes duration of the animation (enter value in seconds)

For example:
```html
<div
    class="yb-seal yb-seal-slide-right" yb-seal-duration="2"
></div>
```

The library supports several animations:
- `yb-seal-slide-up`
- `yb-seal-slide-down`
- `yb-seal-slide-right`
- `yb-seal-slide-left`
- `yb-seal-zoom-in`
- `yb-seal-zoom-out`
- `yb-seal-flip-left`
- `yb-seal-flip-right`
- `yb-seal-flip-up`
- `yb-seal-flip-down`
